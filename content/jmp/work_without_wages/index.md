## Abstract
In this paper, we study a rarely documented firm practice in low-income 
countries that affects millions of workers and has far-reaching implications 
for labor markets: the withholding of employees' wages. Using original survey 
data from Lagos, Nigeria, we find that 30 percent of workers across firms of all 
sizes report delayed or unpaid salaries. We develop a model showing theoretically 
that wage withholding can be nearly costless for firms and even increase 
employee effort when contractual enforcement is weak. To examine how wage withholding 
affects workers' effort and labor-market participation, we implement a field experiment. 
We find that delaying wages increases employees' initial 
effort, without affecting absenteeism or total hours worked.
Signaling salary reliability significantly increases job take-up by about 25 
percent, an effect driven predominantly by individuals who had initially 
expressed no interest in wage employment. However, these workers are no more productive 
than those who accepted jobs without a salary guarantee, suggesting that firms face minimal costs 
from engaging in this practice. In contrast, workers place high value on 
reliable pay, yet weak enforcement and limited worker alternatives create 
a moral hazard for firms to withhold wages.
