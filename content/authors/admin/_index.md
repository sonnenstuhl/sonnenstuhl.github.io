I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy. My research explores how institutional environments in low-income countries shape economic behaviors and individual decision-making. Currently, my work is based in Nigeria, where I investigate the impact of weak formal institutions on labor markets—particularly through uncertainty around wage payments and failures in enforcing employment contracts. Additionally, I examine how informal institutions, especially religion, can foster cooperation and stability in settings where formal mechanisms are limited or ineffective. More broadly, I study religion itself as a significant social and economic institution influencing people’s lives.
