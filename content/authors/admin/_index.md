I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Chicago, in the Harris School of Public Policy. My research focuses on better understanding the 
implications of low-income countries' institutions on peoples' lives, and the choices they make. At the moment, I am conducting all 
My research in Nigeria. 

You can find my CV [here](uploads/CV_Sonnenstuhl.pdf).
