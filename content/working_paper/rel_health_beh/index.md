abstract: Many low-income countries suffer from limited contract enforcement and an ensuing
low-trust environment. This can create labor market frictions by establishing mistrust
between employers and employees. While consequences for  rms have been well es-
tablished, this paper illuminates the consequences for the labor supply side. Drawing
on original data from Nigeria, this paper shows that workers are concerned about an
employer not honoring the work agreement and paying wage as agreed. This concern di-
rectly a ects peoples' preferences and seems to make self-employment more attractive.
Quantifying the degree of uncertainty with a choice experiment, this paper  nds that
workers value a very high degree of certainty about correct wage payment equivalent
to a 16.8% salary increase. Hence, this paper suggests that the inherently uncertain
environment of low-income countries can have direct implications for workers and their
choices when seeking employment.
