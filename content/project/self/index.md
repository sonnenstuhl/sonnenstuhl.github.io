## Abstract
Understanding how salary uncertainty affects worker behavior is essential for 
assessing its broader economic consequences in settings where contract enforcement is weak.
In this study, we investigate two central questions:
(i) Does salary uncertainty, including delayed wage payments, affect employee behavior, such as 
absenteeism, quit rates, and productivity? (ii) Does salary uncertainty deter 
jobseekers from entering wage employment? We address these questions through original 
survey data and two field experiments conducted in Lagos, Nigeria.
