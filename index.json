This can create labor market frictions by establishing mistrust between employers and employees. While consequences for firms have been well established, this paper illuminates the consequences for the labor supply side. Drawing on original data from Nigeria, this paper shows that workers are concerned about an employer not honoring the work agreement and paying wage as agreed. This concern directly affects peoples‚Äô preferences and seems to make self-employment more attractive. Quantifying the degree of uncertainty with a choice experiment, this paper finds that workers value a very high degree of certainty about correct wage payment equivalent to a 16.8% salary increase. Hence, this paper suggests that the inherently uncertain environment of low-income countries can have direct implications for workers and their choices when seeking employment.\n","date":1693526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693526400,"objectID":"a044855ab679b844f8dce4ecc7122e1c","permalink":"https://sonnenstuhl.github.io/project/self/","publishdate":"2023-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/self/","section":"project","summary":"This projects investigates the implications of weak institutions for the labor supply side.","tags":null,"title":"(Self-)Employment and Weak Institutions","type":"project"},{"authors":[""],"categories":null,"content":"Abstract Religion has influenced human lives for centuries. But despite its undeniable importance, we still lack systematic evidence on the implications of people‚Äôs real-life interactions with religious institutions. How does joining a church affect individuals‚Äô lives? What are the specific impacts of different religious motifs? And what motivates individuals to join a church in the first place? Through a unique partnership with one of the largest Nigerian Pentecostal denominations we will address these questions and provide causal evidence on the impacts of religious engagement using the context of African Pentecostalism, one of the most remarkable phenomena of religious dynamism. We will examine four distinct aspects of people‚Äôs interactions with Pentecostal churches. First, the salience of different religious motifs in the denomination‚Äôs proselytization activities allow us to identify the motivations underlying people‚Äôs decision to join a Pentecostal church. Second, the denomination‚Äôs proselytization activities rely on randomly approaching pedestrians at public locations. This creates a quasi-experimental research design allowing us to apply an instrumental variable strategy, instrumenting the decision to join the Pentecostal denomination with contact from the LFW proselytization team. Third, we will disentangle the effect of joining a Pentecostal denomination into different channels using a pre-registered randomized controlled trial (RCT). We will use the denomination‚Äôs practice to integrate new church members into the community by offering study groups. Fourth, we will develop an extension of the club good model to account for the observed empirical patterns of religious dynamics in urban Nigeria.\n","date":1682899200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682899200,"objectID":"fdbc70163e2e96023f80bb51259b23dc","permalink":"https://sonnenstuhl.github.io/project/rel_health_behav/","publishdate":"2023-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/rel_health_behav/","section":"project","summary":"This projects investigates people‚Äôs interactions with Pentecostal churches in Nigeria.","tags":null,"title":"Religion, Health, and Behavior: Evidence from Nigeria","type":"project"},{"authors":["Daniel J.

We use data on repeated interactions between a large sample of U.S. physicians and many different insurers to document the complexity of health care billing, and estimate its economic costs for doctors and consequences for patients. Observing the back-and-forth sequences of claim denials and resubmissions for past visits, we can estimate physicians‚Äô costs of haggling with insurers to collect payments. Combining these costs with the revenue never collected, we estimate that physicians lose 18 percent of Medicaid revenue to billing problems, compared with 4.7 percent for Medicare and 2.4 percent for commercial insurers. Identifying off of physician movers and practices that span state boundaries, we find that physicians respond to billing problems by refusing to accept Medicaid patients in states with more severe billing hurdles. These hurdles are quantitatively just as important as payment rates for explaining variation in physicians‚Äô willingness to treat Medicaid patients. We conclude that administrative frictions have first-order costs for doctors, patients, and equality of access to health care. We quantify the potential economic gains‚Äîin terms of reduced public spending or increased access to physicians‚Äîif these frictions could be reduced and find them to be sizable.\n","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"d41354523ccc2d79aa049aa9f5e69a7e","permalink":"https://sonnenstuhl.github.io/working_paper/self/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/working_paper/self/","section":"working_paper","summary":"This projects investigates the implications of weak institutions for the labor supply side.","tags":null,"title":"(Self-)Employment and Weak Institutions","type":"working_paper"}]
